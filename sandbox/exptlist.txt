(1) ResNet 18,34,50,101 : use imagenet pre-trained model : effect of depth
(2) DenseNet18, ResNet18, InceptionNet, pre-trained models: effect of architecture
(3) Geometric augmentation vs. regular: noise vs. background modeling with augmentation
(4) Cross-validation on 17 sites of ABIDE-1
(5) Transfer-learning for DS030
(6) Transfer-Learning for TCIA-GBM
(7) ResNet-IQM Hybrid model
    (a) cross-validated on ABIDE-1
    (b) transfer-learning on DS030
    (c) transfer-learning on TCIA-GBM requires computation of IQM
(8) Visualization: Grad-CAM for entire slice, normalize the weights
